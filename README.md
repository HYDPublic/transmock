# TransMock - making testing of BizTalk integrations with mocking a reality
This neat little framework allows you to fasttrack your testing experience of BizTalk server integrations to new hights without the hustle of setting up complex test environments and extra cost for test system licenses. You simply author tests with BizUnit and utilize 4 mock test steps that allows you to test any thinkable messaging scenario to and from your integrations. And all that is executed on your developer box and on the build server, allowing you to very quickly boost the quality of the integrations by testing those much earlier than waiting to deploy to a system test environment.

## TransMock 1.3
